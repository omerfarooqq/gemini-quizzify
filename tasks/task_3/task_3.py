    This function should render a file uploader in a Streamlit app, process uploaded PDF files
    to extract their pages, and return the total number of pages across all uploaded documents.
    
    Steps to implement:
    1. Render a file uploader widget that accepts multiple PDF files.
    2. Initialize an empty list to keep track of the pages from all documents.
    3. Loop through each uploaded file, saving it temporarily and processing it to extract pages.
    4. Display the total number of pages processed and return this number.
    """
    
    # Step 1: Render a file uploader widget. Use st.file_uploader with appropriate arguments.
    # The file uploader widget should accept multiple PDF files.
    # https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/widgets/st.file_uploader
    
    # Step 2: Initialize an empty list for storing pages.
    pages = []
    
    # Check if any files have been uploaded
    if uploaded_files is not None:
        for uploaded_file in uploaded_files:
            # Step 3: Process each uploaded file.
            # a. Save the uploaded file to a temporary file. Use tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile.
            
            # b. Use PyPDFLoader to load the PDF from the temporary file path.
            # c. Append the loaded pages to the 'pages' list.
            
            # Example for step 3a and 3b:
            # with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, suffix=".pdf") as tmp_file:
            #     tmp_file.write(uploaded_file.getvalue())
            #     tmp_file_path = tmp_file.name
            #
            #     # Now load and process the PDF file using Langchain's PyPDFLoader
            #     https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/pdf#using-pypdf
            #
            #     # Step 3c: Clean up by deleting the temporary file
            #     os.unlink(tmp_file_path)

    # Step 4: Display the total pages processed. Use st.write() for output.
    # st.write(f"Total pages processed: {len(pages)}")
